Dimensionality reduction by nature priortizes variance. In this activity, sometimes minoroity groups and outliers may be left out as noise. One of the cornerstones of ethics to my mind is fair treatment of all, so it isn't much of a stretch to say that you risk introducing bias anytime you engage in activities that actively seek to discard portions of a data set. Life is full of nuance, and so is data. Within this project you can see that we created visualizations. Not all visuals would be interpreted exactly the same by every person. Even simple things like a color choice, can skew opinions in tricky ways. Obviously, larger and diverse data sets, interpreted by a diverse audience, are far less likely to be significantly biased than the alternative.
